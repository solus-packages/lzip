summary    : Lossless data compressor
description: |
    Lzip is a lossless data compressor with a user interface similar to the one of gzip or bzip2. Lzip is about as fast as gzip, compresses most files more than bzip2, and is better than both from a data recovery perspective. Lzip is a clean implementation of the LZMA "algorithm".
